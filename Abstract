This infographic was created to visualize data on autism prevalence and the sex ratio between males and females. This infographic represents new research, and how it has changed autism data and diagnosis. Additionally, a word cloud was created to help viewers new to autism and autism data understand what the condition is.


The data for the autism prevalence graph came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data for autism signs and symptomology are my own gathered from twenty consumer health websites in October 2023. For this dashboard, I used Python (in Google Colab with Pandas and Plotly Express), Voyant, and Canva for data visualizations. Canva was also used to create the infographic itself. The title was generated by Chat GPT, then modified by the creator. GitHub was used to host the dashboard and supplementary information. The intended audiences for this dashboard are autistic people and their loved ones, autism researchers, and clinicians who want to learn specific data about autism.
